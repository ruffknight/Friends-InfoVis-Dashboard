## Project Overview

Drawing inspiration from the iconic TV show "Friends," during the Information Visualization 2021/2022 course we embarked on a journey to design an information-rich dashboard, merging analytical expertise with creative nostalgia in order to provide fans with an engaging experience. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including d3.js), the team created an interface that presents data and enables exploration while capturing the essence of the show.

### Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following stack:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (d3.js) for frontend development.
- Python (Pandas) for data manipulation and analysis.
- Hitachiâ€™s Pentaho Data Integration & Analytics for data processing and manipulation.
- Microsoft Excel for data exploration and preprocessing.
- LaTeX for comprehensive project documentation.
